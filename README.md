# Content Sharing - Web App

A better way for content to be discovered and consumed for time poor business decision makers who need to be served content at the right time and place.

This app will help:
- Reduce financial and environmental costs of event execution, such as print and freight;
- Reduce risk exposure to 3rd party logistic and print vendors;
- Real time access to contacts information;
- Reduce time to contact leads;
- Provide a holistic view of customer engagement at an event; and
- Recommend assets based on interest. 

** For optimal results please use both print and digital for content distribution.
